#+TITLE: BDD + NOTES
#+AUTHOR: Peter Moresi
#+OPTIONS: num:nil

* Overview

*BDD + NOTES* is a software development methodology that combines two methodologies:

  1. Software specified through /concrete examples/ written for automated test execution with a *Behavior Driven Development (BDD)* test framework.

  2. Software created as /notes/ that describe the program logic in a natural language for human understanding and makes use of a *Literate Programming* toolchain.

BDD and Literate Programming are used together to create a better solution then when either methodology is used alone.

* Tools

  There are many tools for BDD and literate programming. It is important that you pick the best one for yourself based on your needs.

  The combination that I typically use is:

   - [[http://cucumber.io][Cucumber]] with [[http://ruby-lang.org][Ruby]]
   - [[http://org-mode.org][Org-Mode]] with whatever gets the job done with the best quality in least amount time

   Org-Mode is a powerful tool for literate programming with a huge impact on your workflow. The learning curve is steep. You will love it or hate it.

   The quick and dirty literate programming style used by docco and friends is great when you want to augment your workflow and not completely replace it. The
   large number or ports means that you will probably be able to find one for your programming language.

   1. C# Programmers

      - [[http://specflow.org][Specflow]] with C# or [[http://www.fitnesse.org/][Fitnesse]] with .Net fit

   2. Clojure/Java Programmers

      - [[http://www.fitnesse.org/][Fitnesse]] with Java
      - [[https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia][Marginalia]] with Clojure

   3. Rails Programmers
